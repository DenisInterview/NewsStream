EVANSVILLE, Ind. — Murray State guard Ja Morant was determined to finish the job Saturday night. With the Racers' NCAA Tournament hopes on the line, the sophomore standout carried the load in the second half in front of more than 10,000 fans at Ford Center. Morant scored 22 of his game-high 36 points after the break and made all nine of his free-throw attempts to give Murray State a 77-65 victory over Belmont in the Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Championship. With the win, the Racers (27-4) captured the league's automatic bid into the NCAA",

There has&nbsp;even been speculation he could&nbsp;get more than $13m&nbsp;a year on his new deal.</p> \n<p>Widely considered&nbsp;one of the best in the league at his position, Thomas&nbsp;tallied 22 total tackles and three interceptions before being sidelined last season.</p> \n<p><strong>Landon Collins</strong></p> \n<p>The New York Giants declined to place the franchise tag on the safety, which would have cost&nbsp;the team around $11.2m&nbsp;for the 2019 season.</p> \n<p>Collins racked up&nbsp;96 total tackles and four pass breakups in 12 games for the Giants but&nbsp;suffered a partially torn rotator cuff in Week 13 that required&nbsp;surgery after he was placed on injured reserve. Still, he should have plenty of suitors, with reports the Kansas City&nbsp;Chiefs&nbsp;expect&nbsp;to make Collins \"a priority\"&nbsp;this offseason.</p> \n<p><strong>Teddy Bridgewater</strong></p> \n<p>With Joe Flacco headed to the Denver Broncos&nbsp;and Nick Foles seemingly bound for the Jacksonville Jaguars, the New Orleans Saints backup is arguably the best remaining quarterback available, but Bridgewater comes with&nbsp;baggage.</p> \n<p>Last year, in his first full season back after suffering a gruesome knee injury in Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;training&nbsp;camp in 2016, Bridgewater impressed during preseason&nbsp;with the New York&nbsp;Jets. However, he was traded to New Orleans ahead of the start of the regular season. He eventually&nbsp;got&nbsp;in some work in Week 17 after the Saints clinched the top seed in the NFC playoffs, though he put on a lacklustre&nbsp;performance as he finished&nbsp;14 of 22 for 118 yards.</p> \n<p>Eager to continue his comeback, Bridgewater deserves the chance to at least compete for a starting job again.</p> \n<p><strong>Tyrann Mathieu</strong></p> \n<p>The&nbsp;Texans safety bet on himself last season by signing a one-year deal with Houston&nbsp;for a somewhat measly $7m. The wager paid off as Mathieu&nbsp;helped lead them to a division title in&nbsp;a season in which Houston finished 12th in the NFL in total defense,&nbsp;proving&nbsp;to be a valuable player in the secondary once again.</p> \n<p>Last year's safety market was bad, with no player at the position receiving the money they deserved.</p> \n<p>With plenty of top-tier safeties available this year, it will be interesting to see if that changes, as Mathieu is&nbsp;well worthy of a lucrative payday. The 26-year-old is athletic, productive and versatile.&nbsp;He&nbsp;also showed good leadership as he helped mentor rookie safety Justin Reid.</p>",

(Getty Images)\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p>TAMPA, Fla. -- A slow-played Sunday morning found half the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/ny-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a>&nbsp;boarding a bus bound for Lakeland, many with a paper coffee cup in one hand, a paper plate of eggs in the other, a bat bag slung over one shoulder. The rest stayed behind to play the Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>\n<p>An hour’s an hour, and the disappearance of just the one served to heighten gravity’s devilish pull on another day like the one before and the one before that.</p>\n<p>Reggie Jackson, he’s 72 now, padded into the clubhouse, nodded good morning and, on the fly, paged through a print edition of the New York Post. Ron Guidry, 68, unhurriedly chased wisps of steam from his black coffee. Willie Randolph, 64, stopped, said his oldest grandchild is 10 now and that he lives near enough to them all to see them grow, then smiled at wherever the years go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/8634/\">Giancarlo Stanton</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/9877/\">Aaron Judge</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/7850/\">Troy Tulowitzki</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/8289/\">Brett Gardner</a>&nbsp;were in the lineup but not in the locker room.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/7912/\">Jacoby Ellsbury</a>’s jersey has been hanging in the same locker for a month, untouched, not pondered upon. A slow-played&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/6603/\">CC Sabathia</a>&nbsp;(heart, knee, five-game suspension), reasonably encouraged he said by his football team&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/antonio-brown-traded-to-the-raiders-steelers-053946591.html\">trading for Antonio Brown</a>, sat in his chair with a paper cup on the floor between his legs and spat at that.</p>\n<p>The Yankees might win the World Series or come reasonably close. But not today. Troy Tulowitzki will be a major league shortstop again and wield a feared bat again in regular season games again, for a relevant team, and he’s not quite there today, but he’s close enough for today.</p>\n<p>What he knows is that every day he discovers a little something from his past. So, while Yankees fans here stumble through a scattered and thin Tulo chant, the one that echoed first in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/col/\">Colorado</a>&nbsp;and then in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/tor/\">Toronto</a>, Tulowitzki asks his body and mind to recall what they did with a fastball in, or away, or how they jumped a ball in the hole, and what that throw was like. It’s repetition. It’s recovery. Then repetition again. On a slow-play Sunday coming up on the middle of March, two-and-a-half weeks before it comes for real, it’s peeling the uniform off when plenty of his teammates are long gone.</p>\n<p>“Right now, the most enjoyable thing for me is being out on the field, in the dirt,” Tulowitzki said. “It’s been so long. And I knew it wouldn’t be easy.”</p>\n<p>In the middle of the summer of ‘17, Tulowitzki had stopped playing baseball. He was 32. His feet were sore all the time. He’d tried to make it work, tried to balance himself away from the pain, somewhere else on his feet, and then new places hurt. He couldn’t be the player he had to be anymore, could barely be the human being he wanted to be anymore.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c85a5b5250000cd03c8bd86.jpeg\" alt=\"New York Yankees' Troy Tulowitzki runs the bases after hitting a solo home run in the first inning during a spring training baseball game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Monday, Feb. 25, 2019, in Tampa, Fla.

(AP)\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p>“There were many days,” he said, “sitting on the couch I couldn’t get up to go to the bathroom. And I’d say to myself, ‘Man, how the heck am I going to do this?’ ”</p>\n<p>He meant the baseball. How was he ever going to be a functioning baseball player again? Beyond that, maybe, be a great baseball player?</p>\n<p>All that, all the worry, all the inactivity, all the resignation, all the days spent looking out at some cloudy future, is the reason for all this. Why he hunts at-bats. Why he can’t wait for minor-league games to come, so he can find more of them. Why he smiles at the notion of some clubby having to knock real dirt off these very spikes, at having a sun-reddened neck that stings to the touch, at going oh-fer with two strikeouts and a double-play grounder against the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/pittsburgh/\">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, because progress and full health and comebacks are measured in something other than spring averages. Some days, it’s measured in one’s ability to get out of bed in the morning. Others, it’s this muscle firing exactly on time, and this bat head being precisely where it was intended to be, and some guy stopping at second base, looking him up and down and saying, “Hey, man, good to have you back.”</p>\n<p>The best part, he said late Sunday afternoon, “Is just the grind of how hard it is. When you get the game taken away from you and you have to watch a lot of games, I remember thinking, ‘Man, the next time, if there’s a next time, I’m going to enjoy it.’ I know I have work in front of me. But each and every day something happens where I’m like, ‘Yeah, that was good. I can still do that.’ ”</p>\n<p>One day, with any luck, he’ll be one of those guys carrying a coffee cup and shuffling in soft shoes across a clubhouse that isn’t really for them anymore. That could be his jersey hanging unattended in some locker room somewhere, some jersey he’d never actually touched. He’s been close before. But not today.</p>\n<p>Instead, he’d be the guy who struck out twice and grounded into a double play.</p>\n<p>“Which,” he pointed out, “is really not a good day.”</p>\n<p>Except that it was. In fact, as far as days go, they don’t come much better.</p>\n<p><strong>More from Yahoo Sports:</strong></p>\n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/antonio-brown-traded-to-the-raiders-steelers-053946591.html\"><strong>Steelers agree to trade Brown to Raiders in blockbuster deal</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/lebron-james-trade-jeff-van-gundy-disaster-season-034106887.html\"><strong>Van Gundy suggests Lakers explore LeBron trade this summer</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/college-basketball/bigboard/\"><strong>NCAA tournament big board: Gonzaga now No. 1 overall?</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/former-yankees-slugger-alex-rodriguez-actress-singer-jennifer-lopez-engaged-021559225.html\"><strong>Report: A-Rod and JLo are engaged after beach vacation</strong></a></p></li> \n</ul>",

Documents published by The Sunday Times appear to show that executives from Al Jazeera signed the television contract as the bidding campaigns to host the World Cup came to a close. The alleged contract included a fee of $100m that would be paid into a designated FIFA account if Qatar was successful in the World Cup ballot in 2010. In December that year, Qatar surprisingly beat rival bids from the United States, Australia, South Korea and Japan to host the tournament. Al Jazeera was owned and controlled by Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who was the driving force behind the bid. The Sunday Times also alleges that a further $480m was offered by Qatar three years later. Damien Collins, who is the chairman of the British government’s digital, culture, media and sport committee, called on FIFA to freeze the payments from Al Jazeera and launch an investigation into the apparent contract that “appears to be in clear breach of the rules”. In an email response to questions from the Sunday Times on Friday, FIFA wrote that “allegations linked to the FIFA World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by FIFA, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on FIFA.com.” DOWNLOAD THE PUNCH NEWS APP NOW ON Receive Alerts on: Whatsapp: +2349090060943, Twitter: @MobilePunch , BBM: C003D3DC0 Share your story with us: SMS: +2349090060943, Whatsapp: +2349090060943, Email: [email&nbsp;protected] FOREX, BITCOIN,BINARY ACCOUNTS MANAGER: We guaranteed 37% weekly profit by professionally trading your Forex, Cryptocurrency and Binary accounts for you.

It just mean we have to work harder, but I am really proud of what our team has done already. </p>\n<p>\"I'm not worried or disappointed. I'm incredibly encouraged and enthused that we are working as hard as we are. We have a hill to climb, but we know how to do it. </p>\n<p>- 'We are the champions' -</p>\n<p>\"We've got the best team around us. We have experience and it's no coincidence that we are the champions.\"</p>\n<p>The only man to have beaten Hamilton in the last five years was his 2016 Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. </p>\n<p>He promptly retired, to be replaced by Valtteri Bottas, leaving Hamilton to reign supreme as the record-breaking global face of the sport.</p>\n<p>But Hamilton is not the only man to face a challenge.</p>\n<p>Vettel, himself a four-time champion, has a new team-mate in the scarlet scuderia following the team's recruitment of Leclerc from the Swiss team Sauber, this year renamed as Alfa Romeo Racing.</p>\n<p>Fast and smooth, the Monegasque prodigy, 21, will pose a sharper threat than his predecessor, the 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen, now 39, as Vettel, in his fifth Ferrari season, seeks to begin emulating the feats of his compatriot Michael Schumacher who won his first title with the team in his fifth year.</p>\n<p>Binotto, who has graduated from the team's technical department to replace fellow-Italian Maurizio Arrivabene, is expected to give Ferrari a cooler and more technical edge in which reliability will be of paramount importance. </p>\n<p>- McLaren, Williams face battles -</p>\n<p>In 2018, they lost the title through mistakes and failings as much as Mercedes prevailed with dogged consistency.</p>\n<p>\"Our two drivers will be free to fight,\" said Binotto. \"But, certainly, if there is a big situation at the start of the season, Sebastian is the one who has more experience. </p>\n<p>\"Many years he has been with us. He has already won championships. So, he is our champion.\"</p>\n<p>Mercedes and the American-owned Haas team are the only ones to field an unchanged drivers' line-up while two teams, Force India and Sauber, have changed their names to Racing Point and Alfa Romeo respectively.</p>\n<p>If that signals a tricky pile of pre-race homework for the commentators, it reflects a deeper sense of change and challenge for the new owners as once-great teams like McLaren and Williams slump and historic circuits like Monza and Silverstone face an uncertain future.</p>\n<p>Ferrari may be without a title for more than a decade, but they compete at the front while McLaren and Williams have been relegated to the also-rans, the latter in embarrassing fashion after failing to be ready on time for testing earlier this month.</p>\n<p>Technical director Paddy Lowe departed to take \"a leave of absence\" soon afterwards leaving them in some disarray little more than a week before the opening session at Albert Park.</p>\n<p>str/dj</p>",

He’s just 820 assists behind sixth-place Oscar Robertson and 1,268 behind third-place Steve Nash.</p>\n<p>Paul is only 33 years old, and although he has only ever played a full 82 games once in his career, he could play for at least another five seasons. Each of the top four players in assists played through their age-38 season, and Paul will have the benefit of modern medicine.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/report-chris-paul-signs-four-year-max-contract-stay-rockets-043256519.html\">He’s already signed through 2021-22</a>.</p>\n<p>Assuming he plays the rest of the season, Paul is on pace for 492 assists this year. He’s averaging 504 assists over the past three seasons, and if he can keep it up, he should have no problem making it past Nash’s 10,335 mark. He might even have an outside shot at surpassing Jason Kidd (12,091) for second-most all-time.</p>\n<p><strong>More from Yahoo Sports:</strong></p>\n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/antonio-brown-traded-to-the-raiders-steelers-053946591.html\"><strong>Steelers agree to trade Brown to Raiders in blockbuster deal</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/lebron-james-trade-jeff-van-gundy-disaster-season-034106887.html\"><strong>Van Gundy suggests Lakers explore LeBron trade this summer</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/college-basketball/bigboard/\"><strong>NCAA tournament big board: Gonzaga now No. 1 overall?</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/former-yankees-slugger-alex-rodriguez-actress-singer-jennifer-lopez-engaged-021559225.html\"><strong>Report: A-Rod and JLo are engaged after beach vacation</strong></a></p></li> \n</ul>",

Is the manager gonna get blamed for that ... for screwing up the line?\"</p>\n<p>The more baseball embraces gambling, the more we’re going to hear from Pete Rose. Never mind that Rose spends a large chunk of his time signing autographs in Las Vegas just a walk away from any sportsbook, for a certain generations of fans he’ll be on the forefront of their minds every time they place a bet from their phones and walk into a ballpark. It’s a short-term side effect to MLB’s long-term plan to grow the game.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c85554a2500000a0680d777.jpeg\" alt=\"Former Cincinnati Reds player and guest Pete Ross acknowledges spectators during an Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame induction ceremony before a baseball game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Saturday, July 21, 2018, in Cincinnati.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p>Pete Rose is never going to let this go and his next act is turning himself into a martyr. His damnation from baseball giving way to the future of gambling on the game.</p>\n<p>It’s not worth buying into. Gambling was around in baseball before Rose. It’s become more embraced since he left the game. This isn’t a redemption arc, no matter how much Rose wants it to be. It’s cash grab coated in nostalgia.</p>\n<p>\"Ever since I came clean I've been baseball's best goodwill ambassador.\" Rose said to the Daily News, apparently forgetting his years of lying about his gambling habits. “I'm out here in Vegas, spending hours a day, four days a week signing autographs and all I do is talk up all the positive things about the game of baseball. Even when I was betting, I never managed a game I didn't want to win.”</p>\n<p>Pete Rose isn’t sitting at that autograph booth because he wants to, he does it because his fans need him. The game needs him to. Las Vegas needs him to. And he’ll be the first to tell you so. Forget about the fact that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/03/05/pete-rose-book-excerpt\">he collects more than a million dollars annually for his public appearances.</a></p>\n<p>The cognitive dissonance is almost necessary for him. Because gambling is accepted now. And the more Rose ties himself to what got him banned from baseball, the easier it is for other people to not mention his other misdeeds.</p>\n<p>Like pleading guilty to tax evasion in 1990 or more recent claims in 2017 that he had a<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/pete-rose-sexual-relationship-underage-girl-1970s-court-doc-says-172143720.html\"> sexual relationship with an underage girl in the 1970s.</a></p>\n<p>Rose likely bet against his own teams as a manager, if you believe John M. Dowd, whose investigation of Rose’s gambling habits led to the ballplayer’s banishment. Which brings back this truism: Rose isn’t special for betting on baseball and he’s not special for getting caught or banned.</p>\n<p>Shoeless Joe Jackson was banned for alleged gambling in 1919. Nearly thirty more players were banned for doing the same before 1920. Rose’s misdeeds don’t make him a folk hero. His abilities on the field did that. Gambling in baseball is now larger than Rose, which is bad for his brand. The partnership with MGM presents previously unexplored opportunities to reach new audiences, new data points and new revenue streams.</p>\n<p>As he continues to levy his name and stats and autographs in the name of “goodwill” for the game, keep in mind what he noted himself about baseball’s deal with MGM in the first place.</p>\n<p>\"They can say what they want but this is all about money,” Rose said.</p>\n<p>It sure is, Pete. It sure is.</p>\n<p>– – – – – –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/blake-schuster\">Blake Schuster</a>&nbsp;is a writer for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bigleaguestew.com/\">Yahoo Sports</a>.

Tight end George Kittle helped create a little more intrigue <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/george-kittle-recruiting-antonio-brown-49ers-late-night-tweet\">when he reached out to Brown</a> on social media after, he said, Jimmy Garoppolo dared him.</p>\n<p>And Santa Clara appeared to be the preferred destination for Brown, who appeared <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/antonio-brown-posts-picture-him-photoshopped-49ers-jersey\">in a photo-shopped 49ers uniform</a> on his social media account.</p>\n<p>All the while, the 49ers'&nbsp;decision-makers remained silent. General manager John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan did their homework behind the scenes and never showed any interest in engaging in trade talks with the Pittsburgh Steelers. When it came to one of the game's best pass-catchers, the 49ers took a hard pass.</p>\n<p>The Raiders <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/raiders/source-antonio-brown-traded-raiders-two-2019-nfl-draft-picks\">acquired Brown on Saturday night</a>&nbsp;in exchange&nbsp;for a third-round and a fifth-round draft pick. They&nbsp;also reportedly re-worked Brown's contract to pay out more than $30 million in guaranteed money, as part of a three-year $50 million deal.</p>\n<p>Brown, who turns 31 in July, has been ultra-consistent and productive on the field, catching&nbsp;at least 101 passes for 1,284 yards in each of the past six seasons. But the 49ers clearly saw everything else that comes with Brown as being too risky for an organization at this stage of its building process.</p>\n<p>That is not to say the 49ers are set&nbsp;at wide receiver. In fact, they remain interested in adding another playmaker in the passing game.</p>\n<p>The free-agent market is light. But there are indications that if the New York Giants become receptive to trading Odell Beckham Jr. this offseason, the 49ers would be interested in discussions.</p>\n<p>Beckham is four years younger than Brown. He's also believed to be a more compatible fit in the locker room.</p>\n<p>Shanahan has spoken to the importance of adding high-character veteran players who put the team first, have passion for the game and are reliable in the meeting room and practice field. The 49ers likely concluded that Brown falls short in those areas. Without speaking specifically about Brown, Shanahan recently addressed this topic at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis.</p>\n<p>\"You take it into account with everything,\" Shanahan said. \"That's why you like to deal with people you know and have an idea on. We try to hold everyone accountable on our team. We're pretty consistent with that.</p>\n<p>\"So if someone isn't like that, yeah, we do have a problem with that. I don't think anyone is good enough to deal with that.\"</p>\n<p><strong>[RELATED:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/examining-49ers-scheduled-free-agents-and-other-roster-decisions\">Examining 49ers' scheduled free agents, other roster decisions</a><strong>]</strong></p>\n<p>Shanahan is a stickler for precise, disciplined route-running and attention to detail. He also believes veteran players who come in from the outside have the ability to set the tone for the entire locker room.</p>\n<p>\"I do not mind overpaying for character -- guys who are going to come in and work, who compete on the practice field, who can handle being coached, who aren't coming in extremely sensitive and not putting themselves above anyone else,\" Shanahan said after his first season as 49ers coach. \"If you bring in an entitled guy, it hurts your team.\"</p>",

Friday's Class 3A North Lawndale Sectional championship game between the hosts and Farragut was ruled a double forfeit by the IHSA after a fight involving players and fans in the final minute of the fourth quarter. Farragut was leading 54-50 when an Admirals player went up for a dunk and fell. NBC Sports Chicago reported that the Farragut player was undercut by a North Lawndale player — an account that was disputed by North Lawndale President Garland L. Thomas-McDavid, who criticized Farragut's “mob action” — and the fight followed.",

(AP)\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p>Well, Tiger Woods is apparently going to be at The Players Championship in Ponte Vedra, Florida. Whether he’ll play or not is another matter.</p>\n<p>The PGA Tour on Sunday noted that Woods, who withdrew from this week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational with neck pain, would be holding a media conference on Tuesday. While Woods’ conferences are generally light on actual news, they almost always accompany an actual playing position in the tournament itself.</p>\n<p>Woods withdrew from the Arnold Palmer Invitational early last week, noting on Twitter that a recurring neck problem hadn’t improved enough yet to allow him to play:</p>\n<span> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p>1) Unfortunately due to a neck strain that I’ve had for a few weeks, I'm forced to withdraw from the API. I’ve been receiving treatment, but it hasn't improved enough to play. My lower back is fine, and I have no long-term concerns, and I hope to be ready for The Players.</p>— Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TigerWoods/status/1102650638767394817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 4, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> </span>\n<p>While he technically can wait until his Thursday tee time to withdraw from the tournament, Woods will likely make a go-no go decision much earlier than that.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/now?nowId=21-41057297-4\">ESPN’s Michael Collins reports</a>&nbsp;that Woods will hold his customary Tuesday media conference after playing a nine-hole practice round at TPC Sawgrass.</p>\n<p>Woods didn’t make any public comments following his withdrawal from the API, but Rory McIlroy had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://golfweek.com/2019/03/10/golf-pga-tour-tiger-woods-headed-for-the-players-championship/\">noted earlier this week that he’d seen Woods receiving treatment during the WGC-Mexico event in February</a>. Woods has also sported KT Tape, a therapeutic measure, at many of his recent tournaments.</p>\n<p>So far this year, Woods has a T20 in the Farmers Insurance Open, a T15 at the Genesis Open and a T10 at the WGC-Mexico. That trend line bodes well for the Players, where Woods has two wins, in 2001 and 2013.</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/author/jay-busbee/\"><strong>Jay Busbee</strong></a>&nbsp;is a writer for Yahoo Sports.

Let's talk about Mr. Trout for a moment. He’s been in the top-10 list for positional player WAR the last seven years (he’s been in the majors since 2011). He’s been an All-Star every year since 2012. Since 2012, he’s only finished under a .300 BA twice (.287 in 2014 and in 2015 ... when he finished at .299). He hasn’t hit under 25 home runs since 2011. His OPS+ hasn’t been under 150 since 2011. His OPS hasn’t been under .900 since 2011. He’s stolen double digit bases every year except 2011.</p>\n<p>Basically, Mike Trout has been a fantasy gift every year since his rookie season, when he only played 40 games. At age 27, he’s a “don’t question it — just do it” pick.</p>\n<h2><strong>Underrated: Max Scherzer – ADP 6, Staff Composite Ranking: 6</strong></h2>\n<p>Drafting Max Scherzer in Round 1 isn't rare in most leagues; it's expected. With that said, let’s take it a step further, shall we? The argument can be made that Scherzer deserves to be higher up draft boards. Yes, Scherzer deserves a top-five ADP.</p>\n<p>Hear me out. Mad Max finished 2018 as a top-five fantasy asset in innings pitched, strikeouts, wins, and WHIP (for pitchers with over 150 IP). He finished as the No.1 value-based ranked pitcher,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/stats/sp.php?range=2018\">via FantasyPros</a>. And sure, maybe he won’t repeat his beastly 300 strikeouts in 220 and 2/3 innings. Maybe he’ll have a higher WHIP than his hilariously low 0.91 in 2018. And maybe he won’t get as many wins as he did on a Nats team sans Bryce Harper. Fine. But if his last four seasons are any indication, Scherzer ain’t slowing down.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overrated: Ronald Acuna Jr – ADP 10, Staff Composite Ranking: 8</strong></h2>\n<p>Maybe it was his excellent rookie year; maybe it was the injury to Francisco Lindor; or maybe it’s his pedigree (Acuna was the MLB’s No. 2 rated prospect going into the 2018 season). Whatever the reason, the youngster going into his second year is slated to come off the board before the end of the first round.</p>\n<p>Acuna is a truly gifted player who dominated the minor leagues and brought that success with him to the majors (.293 BA, 26 HR, .917 OPS in 2018). I fully expect him to bring his fantasy owners much success in 2019. All that said, I just wouldn’t have him ahead of someone like Jose Altuve or Aaron Judge at the very end of a 12-team draft. Don’t underestimate teams’ ability to figure a young player out; as much as I expect Acuna to continue his ascent, I also expect some growing pains, and maybe even a sophomore slump sometime in 2019 (we saw it with teammate, Ozzie Albies, in the second half of last season). That’s why I’ll look elsewhere if I have a pick between 9th and 12th in the first round.</p>\n<h2><strong>Picks 11-20</strong></h2>\n<h2><strong>Safest bet: Freddie Freeman – ADP 16, Staff Composite Ranking: 16</strong></h2>\n<p>How can you not love Freddie Freeman? The 29-year-old is a career .293 hitter and is usually either the first or second first baseman off fantasy boards. He fills four categories with above-average numbers, and in 2018, he stole a career-high 10 bags. Sure, speed has never been his strong suit, but the willingness to run is another caveat that comes with Freeman.</p>\n<p>Oh, and he’s already hit two bombs in Spring Training this year. He’s as solid as they come, especially at a position lacking category-stuffing options.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-yahoo-fantasy-baseball-draft-kit-235239661.html\"> <img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c81adba2000009d036eda15.jpeg\" alt=\"Fantasy Baseball Draft Kit\" credit=\"\" crediturl=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"300\" data-ops=\"\"> </a></p>\n<h2><strong>Underrated: Alex Bregman – ADP 17, Staff Composite Ranking: 14</strong></h2>\n<p>I really like Alex Bregman. I’d take him in the first round of a 15-team league draft. Sure, he’s probably not gonna put up a gaudy batting average like his tiny infield teammate, but if last season is any indication, the best is yet to come with Bregman. He put up MVP-caliber numbers last season, hitting 31 home runs (up from 19 in 2017). He’s also shown good speed and is obviously one of the more passionate players in the league. He finds himself surrounded by the Judges and Stantons and Harpers and Machados — not to mention the deGroms — of the world at his current ADP, but at just 24 years old, Bregman has the potential to stand toe-to-toe with those giants.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overrated: Giancarlo Stanton – ADP 17, Staff Composite Ranking: 19</strong></h2>\n<p>Speaking of giants, the former NL MVP didn’t have the ideal 2018 in pinstripes. Sure, he hit 38 bombs, but he also struck out 211 times in 617 at-bats. Stanton is just one of those guys who you’re unfortunately going to have to suffer with in some categories, and at his current ADP, I think you can find better multi-category guys (like a Javier Baez or a Manny Machado) to build your team around. The current price for Stanton is just too steep for me. Oh, and the indomitable Dalton Del Don had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/three-advanced-stats-help-find-buys-fades-fantasy-baseball-draft-202836472.html\">a great point about how his launch angle has changed</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Picks 21-30</strong></h2>\n<h2><strong>Safest bet: Charlie Blackmon – ADP 24, Staff Composite Ranking: 26</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/park-factors-top-five-bottom-five-take-advantage-fantasy-233004195.html\">Gotta love a power hitter playing in Coors Field</a>. I’ve seen Blackmon fall past the second round and I’ve seen him go at the top of the second in mocks. Seems like the jury is out on opinions of him. One thing that isn’t an opinion is that he’s scored over 100 runs in three consecutive seasons, and he’s a legitimate 20-20 threat (he stole 17 bags in 2016, and how can we forget when he stole 43 in 2015). He’s 32, but if he returns to his running ways, he’ll be an even bigger category-stuffer worthy of a higher draft pick.</p>\n<h2><strong>Underrated: Javier Baez – ADP 21, Staff Composite Ranking: 18</strong></h2>\n<p>There seem to be two schools of thought when it comes to Baez. One side argues that last season — .290 BA, 34 HR, 111 RBI — was a fluke; a blip on the radar. Others believe it’s a sign of a player reaching his prime. I tend to err on the side of the latter.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c85508a250000e603c8bd79.jpeg\" alt=\"Chicago Cubs second baseman Javier Baez throws to first base for an out during the third inning of a baseball game against the Arizona Diamondbacks Wednesday, Sept. 19, 2018, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\" credit=\"\" crediturl=\"\" width=\"3500\" height=\"2452\" data-ops=\"\"> \n <figcaption>\n  Regression could be in the cards for Javy Baez — or another career-year. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<p>A lot of Baez’s attraction stems from his multi-position eligibility, but consider this. Other than a short 2015 season stunted by early struggles, a broken finger, and a death in the family, Baez’s career numbers have been steadily growing year by year. He played a whopping 160 games last season. At age 26, Baez is in prime position to blow his career highs out of the water in 2019. Sure, his plate discipline — he has a walk rate of under 5% and a strikeout rate of over 25% — raises red flags, but the upside is still too great when you can play him at three different positions. He’s a steal for me at his current ADP.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overrated: Juan Soto – ADP 30, Staff Composite Ranking: 27</strong></h2>\n<p>Full disclosure: Juan Soto helped one of my fantasy teams immensely in 2018, and I picked him up off waivers. His “overrated” designation is more about his ADP than anything else. Soto dominated the minor league system and had a historic rookie season. But would I take him ahead of Blake Snell, Gerrit Cole, or even Whit Merrifield? I would not. There’s plenty of outfield power available at much cheaper prices going forward in most drafts. Soto will have to shoulder more of a load now that Bryce Harper is gone, and I don’t think he’s quite ready to be “the guy” yet — Soto slugged just .236 and batted .181 with runners in scoring position after the 2018 All-Star break.</p>\n<p>Opposing teams will also have no doubt taken notice of Soto’s struggles with off-speed pitches in 2018 (he was in the bottom-10 of every major off-speed and low pitch tracker after the All-Star Break), going into Year 2. He also hasn’t shown a tendency to run (just 14 total stolen bases in both the minor and major leagues).</p>\n<p>Sure, pointing out his negatives under a sea of positives is probably nitpicking, but at his current price, the 20 year old is just too expensive for me. With all that said, I’m bracing myself for the moment this whole paragraph comes back to haunt me after Soto goes .350/.450/.600 in 2019 ...</p>\n<p><strong>Stay tuned for ADP Analysis Part 2 (Picks 31-60) …</strong></p>\n<h2>More from Yahoo Fantasy Sports</h2>\n<figure>\n <iframe width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/Ba58H7l?app=1\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</figure>",

Rumors Lakers Rumors: Brandon Ingram Hopeful To Learn More About Blood Clot On Monday By Matthew Moreno - 03/10/2019 SHARE Facebook Twitter Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports Beyond the disappointment of losing Brandon Ingram for the remainder of the season due to a deep venous thrombosis in his right arm , is concern over how grave of a situation he could face. Chris Bosh dealt with blood clotting that forced him into early retirement. Ingram had missed two consecutive games due to what the team diagnosed as right shoulder soreness. Lakers head coach Luke Walton said there wasn’t much clarity on how Ingram sustained the injury, but there was hope he could return Saturday. Though, Walton added Ingram was experiencing pain and “pulling” whenever lifting his right shoulder above his head. The third-year forward is hopeful he will learn more about his condition and treatment moving forward on Monday, per ESPN’s Ohm Youngmisuk : A source said Ingram hopes to know more about his condition Monday. Walton was peppered with questions about Ingram’s injury and outlook, to which he declined to discuss. “He’s done for the season. We’ve released what he’s got going on, but I’m not going to get into the details of all that. But he will not play again this season,” Walton said. “I’m not going to get into any of that about Brandon right now. I’m just finding out a lot of it myself, so all I’m going to say on him right now is that he’s out the rest of the season.” For Ingram, it’s a second consecutive season he’s had end prematurely because of injury. He came into his own after the All-Star break, averaging 27.8 points on 57 percent shooting over six games. Ingram finished the season averaging a career-high 18.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.

Not only did they bring on David Bell as their new manager, they brought in a whole slew of new players that will make them a better team right away.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a rebuild reaching its pinnacle. Rather, it’s something different, a team making moves to get better even when modern baseball philosophy says they should probably still be in the tanking category.</p>\n<p>But the Reds have finished in last place in the NL Central the last four years, and sometimes that just gets tiresome. So the Reds went out and<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/sources-dodgers-trade-matt-kemp-yasiel-puig-blockbuster-deal-reds-214017864.html\"> traded for Yasiel Puig, Matt Kemp and Alex Wood</a>&nbsp;from the Dodgers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/sonny-gray-traded-yankees-reds-lands-three-year-30-5m-extension-214013848.html\">Sonny Gray from the Yankees</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/reds-acquire-tanner-roark-nationals-001426077.html\">Tanner Roark from the Nationals</a>.</p>\n<p>Combine these guys with the Reds’ centerpiece, the dependable Joey Votto, and some of their young talent like Jose Peraza and Nick Senzel, and you’ve got a team that will be fascinating to watch.</p>\n<p>You’ve also got a number of intriguing fantasy options, whether you’re wondering whether&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/sonny-gray-says-yankees-telling-him-to-throw-a-s-pitch-led-to-his-struggles-225323231.html\">Gray can recapture some of his Oakland glory</a>&nbsp;or Puig can be the Puig of old with more playing time in Cincy. <strong>- Mike Oz</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Reds offseason grade</strong></h2>\n<p>Let’s give the Reds some credit for trying. In an offseason where there’s a pronounced difference between the teams trying to win and the teams trudging through another losing season, the Reds could have easily been in the other category. But they went out and made some notable deals to improve their chances in the competitive NL Central.</p>\n<p>Those deals may still not, in reality, make them better than the Cubs, Cardinals and Brewers, but at least they’re not just sitting around waiting for their youngsters to get better without improving the team right away.</p>\n<p><strong>Our grade: B+</strong> — can’t fault a team for going for it, especially in 2019.<strong> - Mike Oz</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[</strong><a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N360801.1913355YAHOOADMANAGER/B22263112.239448654;dc_trk_aid=436328440;dc_trk_cid=111693485;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=\"><strong>Batter up: Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Cincinnati’s projected lineup and pitching staff</strong></h2>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c8526572300007f0122cc56.jpeg\" alt=\"The Reds projected lineup for 2019.

(Yahoo Sports)\n </figcaption> \n</figure>\n<h2><strong>Who will be the Reds’ fantasy breakout?</strong></h2>\n<p>Cincinnati’s outfield is awfully cluttered following the team’s offseason deal with the Dodgers, a trade that brought both Yasiel Puig and Matt Kemp to town. But if 25-year-old Jesse Winker can find enough at-bats, he has a chance to be fun. Winker was slashing .299/.405/.431 through 89 games last season before a shoulder injury cut his season short. His home run upside could be limited by his line-drive/ground-ball tendencies, but it’s tough to fault his plate discipline and contact ability. Again, playing time is clearly the key to his value. Here’s hoping Cincinnati finds a way to clear the outfield logjam. <strong>-Andy Behrens</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>What is Cincinnati’s biggest fantasy question?</strong></h2>\n<p>Nick Senzel has raked when healthy throughout his minor league career (.314/.390/.513), but injuries have prevented his MLB debut. The team has tried him at a variety of positions in an effort to get his bat to Cincinnati, and it sounds like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/reds/news/nick-senzel-eyeing-starting-center-field-job/c-303943044\">center field could be his eventual home</a>. Senzel will offer double-digit power/speed potential whenever he arrives, along with a respectable average. We can only hope he remains healthy and productive this spring; he remains a prospect of interest, with an uncertain role.</p>\n<p>Fantasy owners also need to keep an eye on the usage of Raisel Iglesias, because his new manager has refreshingly modern ideas about using his best reliever ...</p>\n<span> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p>Bell also said Iglesias won’t be used strictly in the traditional closer role: “He’ll be used in the most important spots in the game. We don’t want to limit him.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/reds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#reds</a></p>— John Fay (@johnfayman) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnfayman/status/1096429233780416513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 15, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> </span>\n<p>At a minimum, we have to reduce the saves projection for Iglesias. He clearly still carries plenty of fantasy value, but vets like Jared Hughes and David Hernandez could poach a few ninth inning opportunities. <strong>-Andy Behrens</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Cincinnati’s Prospect to watch</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s a good chance this will be the last time you see Nick Senzel mentioned as a prospect. Despite being close to the majors the past couple of years, Senzel had injuries put his debut on hold. No more! The Reds want to get Senzel involved badly enough that they are playing him in the outfield. That should give him a shot at playing time in 2019. After that, Senzel could shift over to second base if Scooter Gennett leaves. Senzel has always hit. If he stays healthy, he could be a rookie of the year candidate in the NL. <strong>- Chris Cwik</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Things that MUST go right for the Reds</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>1. Yasiel Puig stays healthy and engaged</strong>: When he's healthy and on his game, Yasiel Puig is among the most dynamic players in MLB. Unfortunately, staying on the field was a problem for him in Los Angeles, whether it be because of injury or simply not showing the level of commitment required by his club. The Dodgers were deep enough to survive Puig's unpredictability, but they obviously grew tired of it. The Reds are less equipped to deal with a Puig roller coaster.</p>\n<figure>\n <iframe width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/LpFJvqU?app=1\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>2. Nick Senzel makes an impact</strong>: With Billy Hamilton gone, the Reds are counting on top prospect Nick Senzel taking over in center field sooner than later. It will be a tall task for a guy who's never played the position in a real game. On top of that, Senzel is coming off a season plagued by injuries, and will be facing MLB pitching for the first time when he debuts. Senzel's talent is unquestioned, but his ability to make a difference this season is highly questionable.</p>\n<p><strong>3. New pitching trio produces</strong>: If the Reds hope to avoid a sixth straight losing season, they're going to need strong seasons from their new starting pitching trio: Tanner Roark, Alex Wood and Sonny Gray. Last season, they combined to win just 29 games while posting a 4.67 ERA. The Reds will need the win total to go up and the ERA to come down if they're to make noise in the NL Central. <strong>- Mark Townsend</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>If this team had a walk-up song, what would it be?</strong></h2>\n<p>Did you know there’s a heavy metal/punk band out there that’s a tribute to Yasiel Puig? Let me tell you, friends, the Internet is a place full of surprises.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://puigdestroyer.bandcamp.com/\">Puig Destroyer</a>&nbsp;isn’t new — it’s been around since Puig burst onto the scene in 2013.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we can’t have a feature like this and in our season previews and not give Puig Destroyer a shout-out. The Reds’ walk-up song should be “Batflip.” As a plus, it might scare the rest of the NL Central. <strong>- Mike Oz</strong></p>\n<figure>\n <iframe width=\"320\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-F0JbTV6DW0\" allowfullscreen=\"false\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</figure>\n<h2><strong>More 2019 MLB Previews From Yahoo Sports</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-baltimore-orioles-season-preview-little-hope-for-fans-or-fantasy-players-151357443.html\"><strong>Baltimore</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-miami-marlins-season-preview-rebuild-is-far-from-over-162429072.html\"><strong>Miami</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/kansas-city-royals-team-preview-more-to-see-for-fantasy-players-than-in-reality-145533593.html\"><strong>Kansas City</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-detroit-tigers-season-preview-can-miguel-cabrera-return-to-form-161231485.html\"><strong>Detroit</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-texas-rangers-season-preview-joey-gallo-headlines-interesting-young-pieces-151956644.html\"><strong>Texas</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-toronto-blue-jays-season-preview-when-is-vlad-jr-walking-through-the-door-153921541.html\"><strong>Toronto</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-san-diego-padres-season-preview-manny-machado-changes-everything-134533540.html\"><strong>San Diego</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-chicago-white-sox-season-preview-waiting-on-young-talent-to-arrive-165447579.html\"><strong>Chicago (AL)</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-minnesota-twins-season-preview-time-for-byron-buxton-others-to-live-up-to-potential-165220780.html\"><strong>Minnesota</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-san-francisco-giants-season-preview-how-far-has-madison-bumgarner-fallen-150511285.html\"><strong>San Francisco</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/pittsburgh-pirates-team-preview-rotation-is-interesting-lineup-is-full-of-questions-141931434.html\"><strong>Pittsburgh</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/arizona-diamondbacks-season-preview-can-their-franchise-player-be-replaced-153253596.html\"><strong>Arizona</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/2019-seattle-mariners-season-preview-can-rookie-yusei-kikuchi-emerge-as-the-new-ace-161200370.html\"><strong>Seattle</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/cincinnati-reds-season-preview-can-their-offseason-moves-revitalize-this-team-163715838.html\"><strong>Cincinnati</strong></a></p>",
